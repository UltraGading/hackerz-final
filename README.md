You have applied to try out for a soccer team. This team is called...the...Screaming Beavers? But they aren't just a soccer team. They do secret cybersecurity work for an even more secret...I cant tell you what it is, its that secret. Their latest mission is to...why am I telling you this, its classified information. Can't I have some privacy? Ok, ok, if you insist. I'll let you in on stuffs. There are highly computerized ACNR(aggregated carbon nanorod) cases that need to be debugged. They contain thermonuclear explosive krelman devices, so if you want to do this stuff, you gotta prove it pal. Also, did you really think I wouldn't tell you who they're working for? It's a secret organization: Poluskeld. It was some experiment in the 1960s, and then it was condemned in 1972. But, it has resurfaced, and its better than ever. Sounds cool? Well if u want the job, we need a ref. If you can pass the game, you're hired. Easy instructions, right?
Awright, to the game.
What do u mean ur the only one testing? It's a two player game, you didn't see that coming. Admit it.
You can be the Blue Agent or the Red Agent, it doesn't really matter, they're the same thing.
Your goal is to last as long as possible.
You can collect data files, which give u points.
You must avoid viruses, or you'll lose a health bar(haha u didn't see that one coming too. Admit it. You won't die instantly, im not that mean.)
You can increase your health by improving ur security(locks, links, alarms)
There are random boosts in the game, which have no purpose lol
ok thats it i explained everything don't try to be nosy.
